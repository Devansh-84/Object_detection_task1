# Object_detection_task1

Object Detection Project

#Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform Object Detection using a machine learning model. It identifies objects in images and provides their labels, confidence scores, and bounding boxes. The notebook utilizes pre-trained models from YOLOv5

#Code Description

The project is structured as follows:

1.) Importing Libraries: The notebook imports essential libraries required for object detection.

2.) Loading Pre-trained Model: A pre-trained object detection model is loaded. This allows for the detection of multiple classes of objects in images.

3.) Performing Object Detection: The notebook processes input images, runs them through the model, and outputs:

The detected objectsâ€™ labels.
Confidence scores for each detection.
The bounding box coordinates for each detected object.

#Example detection output:

Label: dog
Confidence: 0.89
Bounding Box: [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]

4.) Visualizing Results: Detected objects are displayed on the original image, with bounding boxes and labels drawn around them.


#Load your image into the notebook.
Run the code cells to detect objects and display the results.
You will get the following outputs:

Object class names (e.g., "dog").
Confidence scores (e.g., 0.89).
Bounding box coordinates for each detected object.
